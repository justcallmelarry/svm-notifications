# svm-slack-notifications
Modules not installed by default:
– aiohttp
– bs4

Instructions:
Add you username, password and webhook to the appropriate places in the json
file. Then do any changes you would wish to the slack payload (note that the
default settings will post to general and you might not want that)

Then just make the script run every once in a while (like every three hours)
via a cronjob and you will get notified for new biz'es on svm!
